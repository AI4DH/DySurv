# DySurv

This is the code repository for DySurv, a dynamic survival analysis model that uses conditional variational inference and is validated on both simulated and real-world healthcare datasets.

Please review the XMI-ICU repository for code on how to extract the timeseries.csv files from eICU and MIMIC-IV as they are too large for us to upload here. The link is: https://github.com/munibmesinovic/XMI-ICU/tree/main

The notebooks to reproduce the results for the DySurv paper can be found under Models/Results alongside the architecture code. The paper can be found at:
